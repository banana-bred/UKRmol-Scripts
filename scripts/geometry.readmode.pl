# This is a script that I use to read displacements that are generated from something like
# Psi4 or Molpro. The format is relatively hardcoded, but and example is supplied with extension .xyz
# to give you and idea of how it can work.
#
# Geometries can be specified either manually in the array 'geometries'
# by copying what is between start copy and end copy for each geometry
# or automatically as shown below the hash array %geometry
#
# Note that 'length_unit' should be set to the actual length unit used for values in 'atoms' array,
# later (in &generate_geometries) $model{'r_unit'} is set also to this unit for consistency reasons
#
# Note that there's a restriction on the orientation of the molecules in the scripts (although there isn't one in the codes themselves)
# Your molecular target should be oriented as follows for the corresponding point groups ('any orientation' still requires the axes to
# be along the cartesian axes):
# D2h: any orientation
# C2v: C2 axis along Z
# C2h: C2 axis along Z
# D2:  any orientation
# C2:  C2 axis along Z
# Cs:  Molecule in the YZ plane
# Ci:  any orientation
# C1:  any orientation

# ----------- CHANGE THESE, make sure that the geometries agree with the above restrictions
